This is a project to record my code of algorithm questions in LintCode. The basic plan is to write down 2 or 3 questions every day.
If you are also interested to challenge the algorithm questions, welcome to follow me in [LintCode](https://www.lintcode.com/user/Martin_Yan).
Meanwhile, you can apply to join the question group, and you could get stronger ðŸ’ª with other mates in group.

The algorithm problem is a key part in job interview for programmers ðŸ’», to improve the ability of interview and pass it successfully,
and it is necessary to study and practice algorithm questions usually.
This project includes algorithm questions I have written down the level from naive to hard.
If you are interested in algorithm problems, you could star ðŸŒŸ and watch ðŸ‘€ this repository, which will be updated for a long time.
