# Lint-Code

This is a project to record my code of algorithm questions in LintCode. The basic plan is to write down 3 questions every day.
If you also are interested to challenge the algorithm questions, welcome to follow me in [LintCode](https://www.lintcode.com/user/Martin_Yan)
and apply to join the question group. I promise you could get stronger with other mates in group.
